How to compile and run my programs: 

In my main file I will call each each function to print the required task for each program, I will clearly state 
which program is giving back what.

To compile my programs all you have to do is type "make" in your terminal, then "./test"

The Output will then be shown!!

The Output will ask you to pick 1 for p11.c and p12.c and if you press 2 it will take you to p21.c and p22.c.

Program 2.1 isn't working becasue I am only having one array instead of two and I was unable to parse through the points without getting a seg fault this is the 
the same thing with the 2.2 unfortuanly so these two questions I was unable to finish correctly.
